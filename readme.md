The band structure shown in the image is likely simulated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) combined with relativistic effects due to the nature of tellurium (Te), which has strong spin-orbit coupling. The specific mathematical models used for such simulations typically include:

1. Kohn-Sham Equations (DFT)
The fundamental model to describe the band structure is based on the Kohn-Sham equations in Density Functional Theory:

2. Plane Wave Basis & Pseudopotentials
Most DFT calculations for solids use a plane wave basis set:

3. Relativistic Effects (Spin-Orbit Coupling)
Tellurium is a heavy element, so spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is included by modifying the Hamiltonian:


4. Exchange-Correlation Functionals
Common exchange-correlation functionals used to describe band structures in tellurium include:

GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation): PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof)
Meta-GGA or Hybrid Functionals: HSE06 (Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof) for better bandgap accuracy

k-Point Sampling
The band structure is computed along high-symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone. The paths listed in the figure (e.g., 
Œì
Œì-M-K-
Œì
Œì-A) follow crystalline symmetry rules, commonly defined by the Monkhorst-Pack method.

6. Pressure Effects
The comparison between different pressures (0 GPa vs. 3.82 GPa) suggests the use of DFT under hydrostatic compression, which modifies lattice constants dynamically.

Software & Methods
To compute the band structure, researchers typically use software like:

VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package)
Quantum ESPRESSO
WIEN2k (for all-electron calculations)
ABINIT
